## RR_Project4: Making 3 totally funtional CRUD screenflow protoypes in Adobe Xd
#### This project was given by the Full-Stcack developer course provided by Radium Rocket

**Main Objective: Human Resources needs the possibility of managing applicants, clients and interviews.**

The problem of this week consists of making a screenflow based on the following statement:
The **MindSet** company provides Human Resources services to other companies, and has asked us to develop a web system that makes it easier for applicants to upload their data to the system and thus participate in active job searches in MindSet's client companies.
On the main screen of the web system you will be able to see all the job proposals open at the moment without having to have an account created, it is public information.
When an applicant wishes to participate in the job offers, she enters the web and registers as a user by completing her name and surname, email, telephone number, date of birth and full address. This takes you to a sequence of screens that guides you through the process of uploading relevant information for assembling your online CV. The system asks for personal data, primary, secondary, and university studies, informal courses and training, work experiences and data of interest (hobbies, family, etc.). In addition, you must upload a time range in which you can be interviewed by interested companies.
At the end of the process of uploading data for the online CV, the applicant will be able to review and edit the information, and also view a list of available appointments to conduct the interview with a MindSet psychologist. When selecting (reserving) a shift, the user will have the options to cancel or reschedule it from the main screen of the web system. On the day of the interview, the psychologist will evaluate the person's profile to define the types of job opportunities in which they can participant and selec the types of profile

At the end of the interview, the system will automatically apply you to the open positions of companies that look for your profile, sending the CV by email to the person in charge of the company.
If a company wishes to interview, the system will send an email notifying the applicant of the new opportunity and also on the main screen of the system can display web dates interviews with companies and the result of interviews conducted. The applicant may cancel the interviews already scheduled.
When a psychologist enters the system with his username and password, she can see the list of scheduled interviews and edit the next available shifts with date and time for applicants to reserve them.
Psychologists and clients (companies) Mindset are managed by an administrator who has permissions to register, delete and edit customers, open positions and facilitate interviews of applicants for positions such customers.
When an administrator enters the system with his username and password, she can see and edit the list of psychologists, clients, open positions, applicants.
Customers do not have access to the system, they only communicate by email or by phone with the administrator so that he can process the necessary information.
It should be noted that the interview conducted by the MindSet Psychologist is different from the interviews conducted by clients (companies) for open positions. If the interview with the Psychologist has not been carried out, there will be no access to interviews with clients.
The system must allow:

**To the applicant:**
- Enter your data to generate an online CV.
- Set a time range to receive job interviews.
- Book, view and edit interview appointment with a MindSet Psychologist.
- See the list of upcoming interviews, which you can cancel.

- Change your status from "Available" to "Not Available" when you do not want to be applied to new positions.

**To the administrator:**

- Manage clients with their respective contact details.
- Manage open positions of said clients with their respective Job descriptions.
